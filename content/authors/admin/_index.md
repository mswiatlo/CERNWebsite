I am a scientist at TRIUMF, Canada's Particle Accelerator Centre. I work on the ATLAS experiment at CERN, where my work focuses on the triggering and reconstruction of hadronic final states produced by collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. My work enables us to simplify and understand the hundreds of particles produced in these collisions, which we can the use to better understand the Standard Model and physics beyond. I'm particularly interested in using showers of particles called "b-jets" to understand the shape of the vacuum energy potential which creates the Higgs Boson, and to search for new particles that can solve some of the Standard Model's flaws. I'm also interested in novel and wide-ranging applications of deep learning, from triggering and reconstruction to new analysis techniques. 

I'm currently the convener of the Jet/ETMiss group in ATLAS, and I coordinate searches for pairs of Higgs and SUSY particles decaying to many b-jets. In the past, I've also worked on searches for Milli-Charged particles at the LHC, and measurements of QCD using novel jet substructure techniques.

I'm always looking for new undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs, and collaborations, so please drop me a line if you'd like to work together! Open positions will depend on funding on the current project needs.
